### Why Walkthroughs on each day?

I have been wanting to write something tech-related for a while; but in the end I never get to it either because I end up over-complicating my original write-up idea or because I deem it uninteresting for the rest of the world. In the end I believe is mostly due to a lack of practice and over-all _muscle_ when it comes to writing.

I wanted to take this year as a chance for practicing my writing and problem-explaining skills. I can not promise every part of every day puzzle will have a walkthrough; but I'll try.
